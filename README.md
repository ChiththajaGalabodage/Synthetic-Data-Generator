# Synthetic-Data-Generator

Introduction

Synthetic Data Generator is a tool that allows you to create high-quality datasets for training and fine-tuning language models. It leverages the power of distilabel and LLMs to generate synthetic data tailored to your specific needs. 

Supported Tasks:

    Text Classification
    Chat Data for Supervised Fine-Tuning
    Retrieval Augmented Generation

This tool simplifies the process of creating custom datasets, enabling you to:

    Describe the characteristics of your desired application
    Iterate on sample datasets
    Produce full-scale datasets


By using the Synthetic Data Generator, you can rapidly prototype and create datasets for, accelerating your AI development process.
